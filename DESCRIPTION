Description: PathwaySplice is an R package that performs pathway analysis that explicitly adjusts for the number of exons associated with each gene; visualizes selection bias due to different num-ber of exons for each gene; formally tests for presence of bias using logistic regression; supports gene sets based on the Gene Ontology terms, as well as more broadly defined gene sets (e.g. MSigDB) or user defined gene sets; identifies the significant genes driving pathway significance; organizes significant pathways with an en-richment map, where pathways with large number of overlapping genes are grouped together in a network graph
